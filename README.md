Important notes:

Internet Connection: The website uses external resources (videos, images, and audio from catbox.moe, as well as the GSAP library from cdnjs.cloudflare.com). Make sure you have an active internet connection so these resources can be loaded.
Browser Compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) should display the website correctly.
Autoplay Policies: Some browsers have strict autoplay policies for media (especially audio). The start-screen is designed to capture user interaction before media playback to bypass these policies. If you experience issues with media playback, it's likely due to your browser blocking automatic playback until you click or tap on the screen.
